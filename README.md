MyContract

The "MyContract" project in Solidity exemplifies the programming language's key syntax and functionality. The purpose of this project is to provide a functions error and exploring solidty smart contracts

Description

This software is a simple contract written in Solidity, a programming language for generating smart contracts for the Ethereum network. A single function in the contract returns the string "MyContract"

Getting Started

Executing Program
To run this project, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., MyToken.sol). Copy and paste the following code into the file:

// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract MyContract {
    uint public totalValue;

    
    function sellersetValue(uint _value) pure  external {
        //require statement of seller
        require(_value != 4, "the is sum");

    }

    function computerValue(uint _x) external pure returns (uint) {
        assert(_x !=2);
        return _x + 600;
    }

    function printerValue(uint _y) external pure returns (uint) {
        if (_y ==2){
            revert("The value is sum");
        }
        return _y + 100;

    }
}
To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.18" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile MyContract.sol" button.

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "MyConstract" contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.
